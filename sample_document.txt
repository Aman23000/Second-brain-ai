## Introduction to RAG Systems

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based AI systems. This approach has revolutionized how we build AI applications that need to access and reason over large knowledge bases.

## How RAG Works

RAG systems work in three main steps:

1. **Document Processing**: Documents are broken down into smaller chunks and converted into vector embeddings.

2. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system searches for the most relevant chunks using vector similarity.

3. **Generation**: The retrieved context is fed to a language model, which generates a natural language response.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Accuracy**: Provides source-grounded responses
- **Transparency**: Users can see which documents informed the answer
- **Scalability**: Can handle large document collections
- **Privacy**: Can run entirely on local hardware

## Use Cases

RAG systems are perfect for:
- Personal knowledge management
- Enterprise document search
- Customer support automation
- Research assistance
- Legal document analysis

## Conclusion

RAG represents a significant advancement in making AI more practical and trustworthy for real-world applications.
